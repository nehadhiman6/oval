                                <p>To obtain this information, please send an email to info@ovalcare.com with “Request for California Privacy Information,” in the subject line and in the body of your message.

                                <p><b>Verifying Requests:</b> To help protect your privacy and maintain security, we will take steps to verify your identity before granting you access to your personal information or complying with your request. If you have an OVAL account, we will verify your identity by requiring you to sign into your account. If you do not have an OVAL account, or an email address on file with us, then there is no reasonable method by which we can verify your identity to the level of certainty required by the CCPA. This is because historically OVAL has not linked device identifiers or advertising IDs to named actual persons. Accordingly, if you do not have an account with us, or an email address on file, and you request access to or deletion of your personal information, we will not be able to process your request at this time.</p>

To the extent permitted by applicable law, we may charge a reasonable fee to comply with your request. This statement is available in alternative formats upon request.
