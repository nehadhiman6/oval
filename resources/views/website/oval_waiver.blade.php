                    <p>In consideration of my participation in Oval testing protocol and any fitness or wellness activity or exercise program related to Oval testing protocol ("<strong>Program</strong>") as administered by Oval ("Oval") (including its affiliates, officers, employees, agents, successors, and assigns) (collectively, "<strong>Representatives</strong>"), have agreed to execute this Waiver and Release of Liability ("<strong>Waiver</strong>") for myself and my personal representatives, executors, heirs, family members, successors and assigns, and acknowledge, agree to and represent the following: </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><p>I desire to voluntarily participate in the Program (each, "<strong>Participation</strong>") in an attempt to improve my physical fitness, metabolic health, and performance level. My Participation and execution of this Waiver is voluntary. I have read and fully understand the terms of this Waiver, intending to be legally bound by its terms. I agree to abide by any written or verbal instructions or guidelines, as may be revised from time to time, provided to me while participating in the Program as I understand that the information being provided is for the benefit of my health and safety. </p></li>
                        <li><p>I understand that there is a risk of me contracting COVID-19 or other illnesses in any public location and that includes during my Participation at the testing facility. I agree to not use the testing facility in the event I have, or in the fourteen (14) days prior to my testing appointment, have had any symptom reasonably related to COVID-19, or have been exposed to any individual with such symptoms. If at any time after execution of this Waiver, I contract COVID-19, experience COVID-19 symptoms, or become aware that I have been exposed to any individual in the prior fourteen (14) days who has received a COVID-19 diagnosis, I shall immediately notify Oval and shall not return to the testing facility without authorization from Oval following either (i) receipt of a negative COVID-19 test satisfactory to Oval and/or (ii) completion of then-current quarantine guidelines promulgated by federal and state health agencies. Oval has no duty to inform me of any individual with COVID-19 who has used the testing facility.</p></li>
                        <li><p>I also understand there is a certain level of risk associated with any assessment and subsequent exercise program, including the Program, and my body’s response to these various activities cannot be predicted with complete accuracy. All modes of exercise place a workload on the body to promote improvement and at the same time present the risk of negative body response to the workload. I understand that the activities during Participation may range from low to intensive to vigorous and physically demanding intensities that may require maximal effort, and carry with it the potential for death, serious injury, or property loss. I HEREBY ACKNOWLEDGE AND ASSUME THE RISKS OF PARTICIPATION. I agree that I am responsible for any resulting personal injury and damage to or loss of property arising out of my Participation. </p></li>

                        <li><p>I assume the risk of physical injury, illness, or death and agree that my Participation, shall, at all times, be at my own risk. I, ON BEHALF OF MYSELF AND MY PERSONAL REPRESENTATIVES, EXECUTORS, HEIRS, FAMILY MEMBERS, SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS, HEREBY KNOWINGLY AND VOLUNTARILY AGREE TO WAIVE, RELEASE AND DISCHARGE AND COVENANT NOT TO SUE Oval or any of its Representatives from any liability, loss, cost, damage, expense, claim or suit whatsoever for any and all injury, loss, illness, death, harm, cost, expense, claim, suit, or damage related to my Participation, including related to COVID-19, including any negligent acts or conduct by Oval or its Representatives (collectively "<strong>Claims</strong>"). I further agree to indemnify and hold harmless Oval and its Representatives from and against any and all third-party Claims associated with my Participation. </p></li>
                        <li><p>I understand that my Participation in the Program may require the collection of biometric information such as behavioral or biological characteristics, activity patterns or other identifying information, such as height, weight, heart rate, blood pressure, blood lactate, cholesterol, LDL, glucose, HbAIC, sleep patterns, health concerns, diet preferences or exercise data. I agree to allow my information to be collected and used in support of my Participation and to provide me with relevant findings and results. I further agree that Oval or its Representatives may store, analyze, study, aggregate, and publish my information in order to promote or improve the Program’s products and services. However, no information that would allow for me to be personally identified will be disclosed without my prior written consent (except to the extent such disclosure is reasonably necessary to comply with a court order, any Applicable Laws, or the order of any governmental authority).</p></li>
                        <li><p>I hereby grant to Oval and its Representatives the irrevocable and unrestricted right to use and publish photographs and/or videos of me during Participation for advertising and/or any other purpose and to alter and copyright the same without restriction and without expectation of payment. </p></li>
                        <li><p>This Waiver is intended to be as broad and inclusive as permitted by the laws of the State of Colorado. If any portion hereof is held invalid, the balance of this Waiver shall, notwithstanding removal of such invalid portion, remain in full legal force and effect. </p></li>
