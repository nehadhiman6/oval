                        <h4>1. What is a cookie?</h4>
                        <p>Cookies are small text files containing a string of characters that can be placed on your computer or mobile device that uniquely identifies your browser or device. Cookies are small text files that are stored on your computer or mobile device. They are widely used in order to make websites work, or work in a better, more efficient way.

All sites on OVAL Website and app where you are prompted to login or that are customizable require that you accept cookies.</p>
                        <h4>What are cookies used for?</h4>
                        <p>Generally, we use cookies to:</p>
                        <p>(1) Remind us of who you are and to access your account information (stored on our
                            computers) in order to deliver to you a better and more personalized service. This cookie is set when you register or “Sign In” and is modified when you “Sign Out” of our services.
                        </p>
                        <p>(2) Estimate our audience size. Each browser accessing OVAL is given a unique cookie which is then used to determine the extent of repeat usage, usage by a registered user versus by an unregistered user, and to help target advertisements based on user interests and behavior.</p>
                        <p>(3) Assist merchants linked to OVAL to track visits to and business at
                            their stores, and to process the items in your shopping basket. This information collected by cookies is sometimes called “clickstream” or “click trail” and may also describe which pages you have seen in each merchant’s store.
                        </p>
                        <p>(4) Measure certain traffic patterns and your visiting patterns in the aggregate. We use
                            this research to understand how our users; habits are similar or different from one another so that we can make each new experience on OVAL app a better one. We may use this information to better personalize the content, banners, and promotions that you and other users will see on our sites.
                        </p>
                        <p>Advertising networks that serve ads onto OVAL may also use their
                            own cookies.
